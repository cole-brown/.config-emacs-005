;; Which Key:
;;   https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key
;; Which-Key vs Guide-Key:
;;   https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key/issues/29
;;
;; Super useful. Shows what all can be done from the buttons you just pressed.
;; E.g. "C-h" and pausing for a sec will bring up which-key with all the
;; commands in the help-command map.
(use-package which-key

  ;;------------------------------
  :custom
  ;;------------------------------

  ;; `which-key-sort-*'
  ;;-----------------
  ;; Sort lower and uppercase keybinds together instead of all upper then all lower.
  ;; And lowercase goes first.
  (which-key-sort-order           'which-key-key-order-alpha)
  (which-key-sort-uppercase-first nil)

  ;; `which-key-idle-delay'
  ;;-----------------------
  (which-key-idle-delay (unit:second 0.5 'sec)) ; Default: 1.0 seconds

  ;; 'window' size
  ;;------------
  ;; (which-key-side-window-max-width 0.333)    ; Default: 0.333
  ;; which-key-side-window-max-height

  ;; Which-Key & `evil':
  ;;--------------------
  ;;   https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key#evil-operators
  ;;   This is done in `:config' so we can check if we have `evil' enabled.

  ;;------------------------------
  :config
  ;;------------------------------

  ;; 'window' location
  ;;------------
  ;; https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key#special-features-and-configuration-options
  ;; Can change where the which-key windows shows up with one of these:
  ;;   (which-key-setup-side-window-bottom) ;; This is the default.
  ;;   (which-key-setup-side-window-right)
  ;;   (which-key-setup-side-window-right-bottom)
  ;; [2022-07-15] Try out right for a while... It's nice that it's one column of
  ;; keys -> binds instead of 1-5 or whatever for the bottom.
  ;; (which-key-setup-side-window-right)
  ;; [2022-07-22] Getting this error with `which-key-setup-side-window-right' if Emacs is small:
  ;;   > which-key can’t show keys: There is not enough space based on your
  ;;   > settings and frame size.
  ;; Try `which-key-setup-side-window-right-bottom' and see if that makes it happier?
  ;; (which-key-setup-side-window-right-bottom)
  ;; If I don't like that, try tweaking these variables:
  ;;   `which-key-side-window-max-height'
  ;;   `which-key-side-window-max-width'
  ;; [2023-04-18] Don't like it...
  ;;   1. Just too far over to look most of the time.
  ;;   2. Doesn't jive with everyone else defaulting to popping up on the bottom.
  ;;   3. Changing buffer widths all the time makes word-wrapped buffers jitter, sometimes.

  ;; TODO: change to eval after
  ;; (when (imp-feature? 'evil)
  ;;   ;; https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key#evil-operators
  ;;   ;; Evil motions and text objects following an operator like `d' are not all looked up
  ;;   ;; in a standard way. Support is controlled through `which-key-allow-evil-operators'
  ;;   ;; which should be non-nil if 'evil' is loaded before 'which-key' and through
  ;;   ;; `which-key-show-operator-state-maps' which needs to be enabled explicitly because
  ;;   ;; it is more of a hack. The former allows for the inner and outer text object maps
  ;;   ;; to show, while the latter shows motions as well.
  ;;   (setq which-key-allow-evil-operators t
  ;;         ;; NOTE: The docstring says this is experimental and Doom doesn't set it.
  ;;         ;; So remove if weird?
  ;;         which-key-show-operator-state-maps t))

  ;; Enable Global `which-key-mode'
  ;;-------------------------------
  (which-key-mode +1))


;;------------------------------
;; NOTE: Which-Key: Additional Commands
;;---
;; Commands:
;;   https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key#additional-commands
;;
;; `which-key-show-top-level'
;;   - Will show most key bindings without a prefix. It is most and not all,
;;     because many are probably not interesting to most users.
;; `which-key-show-major-mode'
;;   - Will show the currently active major-mode bindings. It’s similar to C-h m
;;     but in a which-key format. It is also aware of evil commands defined
;;     using evil-define-key.
;; `which-key-show-next-page-cycle' / `which-key-show-previous-page-cycle'
;;   - Will flip pages in a circle.
;; `which-key-show-next-page-no-cycle' / `which-key-show-previous-page-no-cycle'
;;   - Will flip pages and stop at first/last page.
;; `which-key-undo'
;;   - Can be used to undo the last keypress when in the middle of a key sequence.

;; Helpful - "A better Emacs *help* buffer"

;; Replace Emacs' default help bindings/buffer with Helpful's much more helpful
;; help buffer.

  ;; `helpful-max-buffers'
  ;;----------------------
  ;; "If this many helpful buffers or more exist, kill oldest when opening another."
  ;; Default is 5. Can change if desired, but I tried 2 and went back to 5.
